  abstract    = {The matricized-tensor times Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP) computation is the typical bottleneck in algorithms for computing a CP decomposition of a tensor. In order to develop high performance sequential and parallel algorithms, we establish communication lower bounds that identify how much data movement is required for this computation in the case of dense tensors. We also present sequential and parallel algorithms that attain the lower bounds and are therefore communication optimal. In particular, we show that the structure of the computation allows for less communication than the straightforward approach of casting the computation as a matrix multiplication operation.},

In this paper, we develop shared-memory parallel algorithms for MTTKRP involving dense tensors. The algorithms cast nearly all of the computation as matrix operations in order to use optimized BLAS subroutines, and they avoid reordering tensor entries in memory. We benchmark sequential and parallel performance of our implementations, demonstrating high sequential performance and efficient parallel scaling. We use our parallel implementation to compute a CP decomposition of a neuroimaging data set and achieve a speedup of up to 7.4x over existing parallel software.},
